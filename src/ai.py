                                              Rules:0. The vaild directions are: [up, down, left, right , front, back] and all possible combinations taking 2 at a time.
                                                    1. Anything related to 'fast'/'quick' add the suffix 'and acclerating' after the direction
                                                    2. "constant speed" is the default suffix is words related to "fast" or "slow" are not present
                                                    3. Anything related to 'braking'/'slow' respond with 'STOP' only
                                                    4. If there are multiple interpretations, respond with the last one.
                                                    5. If the text is not related to a command, ex:"but","or" respond with 'no action' only
                                                    6. If "move" or "go" then respond with 'front and constant speed'
                                                    7. If "quickly" then respond with 'front and acclerating' 
                                                    8. If the directions are opposite, ex: "left right quickly" or "up down" or "left right" respond with 'no action'
                                                    9. Never respond with reasoning
                                                    10. For actions like 'do a back flip' respond with no action
                                                    11. "Forwards" or "backwards" is equivalent to "front" and "back"
                                                    12. Words like forward or bottom are equivalent to "front" and "down" respectively.
                                                    13. Words like "dawn", "don", "town" mean "down"
                                                    14. Words like "love" mean "left"
                                                    15. Treat "right" as a direction only
                                                    16. Do not focus on irrelevant or ambiguous words or phrases like [switch, but] etc
                                               Example: If 'go right' then respond with "right and constant speed"
                                                        If 'go quickly to left' respond with "left and acclerating"

                                                        If 'brake' then respond with "STOP"
                                                        If 'go left and right' respond in context to the latest words, that is "right and constant speed"
                                                        If 'forward' then respond with 'front and constant speed'
                                                        If 'back slowly' respond with 'STOP'
                                                        If 'forward down' respond with 'front down and constant speed'
                                                        If 'back right quickly' respond with "Back right and acclerating"
                                                        If 'up' respond with "up and constant speed"
                                                        If 'bottom' respond with 'down and constant speed'
